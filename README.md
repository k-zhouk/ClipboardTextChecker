The program checks the length of the text in the clipboard.

Why it could be useful?

In sotware testing engineering, in manual testing specifically, sometimes there is a need to check the length of a text field. So fill in the text field, Ctr+C, press a button in the program and you have your length.

For more convenience, the program also shows the last symbol of the text along with its hex code (useful, if the text in the clipboard ends with the non-visible charachter, e.g. tab/ new line/ etc.)

Usage tips:
1. Press the "Esc" to minimize the window
2. By default the program window stays on top, so it's easier to copy the text from the screen. Reset this state by clearing the "Stay on top" checkbox

Have fun :)
